## Room Logger

Let's you log certain things inside a room.

- Logs when a user joins or leaves room
- Logs when a user stands in a certain location (you define this location)
- Logs when a user is sitted in a certain location
- Logs Bots messages
- Logs Player Actions (Sign, Laugh, Kiss, Dance...)
- Discord Webhook logging


All the logs are saved in G-Earth Folder
